Oh ho ho, that's pretty neat.

ok we're done here.

## Math

$$\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}3 +C$$
$$\iint r(\cos\varphi+\sin\varphi)\,d\varphi\,dr$$

Well, if only math equations works natively...

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ciint%20r%28%5Ccos%5Cvarphi&plus;%5Csin%5Cvarphi%29%5C%2Cd%5Cvarphi%5C%2Cdr)

This should work, but it's kind of cumbersome to do...

## Graph

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

Well, if only Mermaid works natively...
